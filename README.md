The purpose of this discord bot is to post funny quotes said by a friend of mine. It's only job is to hold and recall quotes on command.

Commands:
/quote <quote#>: This command will return a random quote, unless a quote # is supplied. Each quote is identified by a id number, starting from 0. 

/add <quote> <year>: This command adds a new quote to the bot, using the quote and a year. Currently not implemented.
  
How to run:
To run this discord bot, you need to install npm and discord.js.
You can get npm here: https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm
You can install discord.js by using the command 'npm install discord.js'.

You will also need to generate a Discord bot token to log the bot in with.
You can find how to do that here. https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/discord.html
